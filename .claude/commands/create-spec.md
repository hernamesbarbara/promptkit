# /create-spec

## Purpose

Scaffold a structured SPEC or PRD (Product Requirements Document) for planning a new feature. The generated spec follows a consistent format that works well with `/create-issues` for breaking down work into discrete tasks.

## Inputs

| Argument | Format | Validation |
|----------|--------|------------|
| `$1` | SPEC_NAME | Required. Lowercase kebab-case (e.g., `user-auth`, `api-caching`). Max 64 chars. |
| `$2` | SUMMARY or FILE | Required. Either: (A) a one-line text summary, or (B) a path to an existing markdown draft file. |

### Input Detection

- **Case A (text summary):** If `$2` does NOT end with `.md` OR the file does not exist → treat as plain text summary (max 256 chars)
- **Case B (file input):** If `$2` ends with `.md` AND the file exists → read file content as context for spec generation

## Output Contract

**Case A (text summary):**
- Success: `Created new spec: SPEC_{name}.md`
- Already exists: `Spec already exists: SPEC_{name}.md`
- Validation error: `Error: {message}`

**Case B (file input):**
- Reading: `Reading draft: {filepath}`
- Success: `Created new spec: SPEC_{name}.md (from {filepath})`
- Validation error: `Error: {message}`

## Instructions

1. **Validate `$1` (name):**
   - If `$1` is empty: output `Error: Spec name is required` and stop
   - If `$1` contains uppercase letters, spaces, or special chars (only `a-z`, `0-9`, `-` allowed): output `Error: Spec name must be lowercase kebab-case` and stop
   - If `$1` exceeds 64 characters: output `Error: Spec name exceeds 64 characters` and stop

2. **Validate `$2` (summary or file):**
   - If `$2` is empty: output `Error: Summary or draft file path is required` and stop

3. **Detect input type:**
   - If `$2` ends with `.md` AND the file exists at that path → **Case B**
   - Otherwise → **Case A**

4. **Check existence:**
   - If `SPEC_$1.md` exists in current directory: output `Spec already exists: SPEC_$1.md` and stop

5. **Case A (text summary):**
   - If `$2` exceeds 256 characters: output `Error: Summary exceeds 256 characters` and stop
   - Generate spec file using the template below, substituting:
     - `{{NAME}}` with `$1`
     - `{{SUMMARY}}` with `$2`
     - `{{DATE}}` with today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Write generated content to `SPEC_$1.md`
   - Output: `Created new spec: SPEC_$1.md`

6. **Case B (file input):**
   - Output: `Reading draft: $2`
   - Read the contents of the draft file at `$2`
   - Analyze the draft content to understand the feature being described
   - Generate spec file using the template below, **intelligently populating sections** based on the draft content:
     - `{{NAME}}` with `$1`
     - `{{SUMMARY}}` with a one-line summary derived from the draft
     - `{{DATE}}` with today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
     - Fill in Overview, Problem Statement, Goals, Proposed Solution, etc. based on what you learn from the draft
     - Do NOT copy-paste the draft verbatim; synthesize and structure the information
   - Write generated content to `SPEC_$1.md`
   - Delete the original draft file at `$2`
   - Output: `Created new spec: SPEC_$1.md (from $2)`

7. **Next steps:**
   - Tell the user to review and fill in any remaining sections
   - Remind them they can use `/create-issues SPEC_$1.md` when ready to break down work

*When ready to break this into discrete issues, run: `/create-issues SPEC_{{NAME}}.md`*
```

## Examples

```bash
# Case A: Basic usage with text summary
/create-spec user-auth "Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers"
# Output: Created new spec: SPEC_user-auth.md

# Case B: Using an existing draft file
/create-spec user-auth ./drafts/auth-notes.md
# Output:
#   Reading draft: ./drafts/auth-notes.md
#   Created new spec: SPEC_user-auth.md (from ./drafts/auth-notes.md)

# Spec already exists
/create-spec user-auth "Different description"
# Output: Spec already exists: SPEC_user-auth.md

# Invalid name
/create-spec UserAuth "Bad name format"
# Output: Error: Spec name must be lowercase kebab-case

# Missing arguments
/create-spec
# Output: Error: Spec name is required

# File path provided but doesn't exist (treated as Case A text)
/create-spec my-feature ./nonexistent.md
# Output: Created new spec: SPEC_my-feature.md (uses "./nonexistent.md" as summary text)
```

## Design Decisions

### Dual input modes
The command accepts either plain text or a file path as the second argument:
- **Text mode** is fast for quick specs when you know what you want
- **File mode** lets you start with rough notes and convert them into a structured spec

### File detection logic
A path is treated as a file only if it ends with `.md` AND exists. This prevents accidental file mode when someone types a summary that happens to end with `.md`.

### Draft file is deleted (renamed)
In file mode, the original draft is removed after the spec is created. This keeps the workspace clean and enforces the naming convention. The original content is synthesized into the spec, not lost.

### Filename convention
Specs are named `SPEC_{name}.md` (uppercase SPEC prefix) to make them visually distinct and easy to glob for. This matches the user's existing convention. Both input modes produce the same naming pattern.

### Created in current directory
Specs are created in the working directory rather than a dedicated folder. Users can organize as needed (e.g., move to `specs/` or `docs/`).

### Structured for create-issues compatibility
The template includes:
- Clear **Acceptance Criteria** with checkboxes
- **Implementation Plan** with phases and tasks
- **Dependencies** section

These sections map directly to fields in issues generated by `/create-issues`.

### Balanced structure
The template balances thoroughness with pragmatism:
- Enough structure to force clear thinking
- Not so rigid that it feels bureaucratic
- Sections can be deleted if not relevant
